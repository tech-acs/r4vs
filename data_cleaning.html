</header><p>There are several simple routines that can help make the preparation of civil registration data for tabulation less time consuming. This vignette uses the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a> suite of R packages to deal with common problems such as incorrect data types, duplicate rows, and missing values.</p>
<p>We will use a synthetic dataset that has the appearance of civil registration data to experiment with. The states of Nigeria are used but otherwise the data are completely fictional.</p>

<code>birth3b</code> (Age, Mother)</li>
</ul>
<p>The variable <code>birth1b</code> (Date of registration, Event) is of type date, <code>id</code> and <code>birth3b</code> (Age, Mother) integer, and the others are all character.</p>

<p>Dates can be inputted in a variety of formats such as “1 August 24”, Aug 1, 2024”, and “2024-08-01”. Sometimes R will not be able to parse a date and will read it as a character.</p>
<p>The variable <code>birth1a</code> (Date of occurrence, Event) is a character but it should be a date. We can coerce it to a date by passing it to the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/as.Date.html">as.Date()</a></code> function and choosing the corresponding date format. <code>birth1a</code> follows the <a href="https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html">ISO 8601</a> standard for dates or ‘YYYY-MM-DD’ so we need to format the data with “%Y-%m-%d”.</p>
