Table 7.1 contains all the values encoded in Figure 7.1.\n\n\n\n\nTable 7.1: Birth and death registration completeness rates in Rwanda, 2019 to 2023\n\nEvent\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n\n\n\nBirth registration completeness rate\n87.0\n85.8\n84.2\n92.9\n90.0\n\n\nDeath registration completeness rate\n31.4\n29.9\n26.2\n31.1\n41.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we can visualise the data in a line chart we need to transform it from a table into ‘tidy’ data (Wickham 2014). To be tidy the data must satisfy three rules:\n\nEach variable must have its own column\nEach observation must have its own row\nEach value must have its own cell\n\nThe key step to make this data ‘tidy’ is to reshape it into ‘long format’ using the pivot_longer() function from the dplyr package (Wickham et al. 2023). This function converts some of the column names into values of a new variable. In this case, the year column names become the values of a new variable called ‘Year’.\n\ntidy_data &lt;- table |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(-Event, names_to = \"Year\", values_to = \"Value\")\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 7.2: Data structured in long format\n\nEvent\nYear\nValue\n\n\n\nBirth registration completeness rate\n2019\n87.0\n\n\nBirth registration completeness rate\n2020\n85.8\n\n\nBirth registration completeness rate\n2021\n84.2\n\n\nBirth registration completeness rate\n2022\n92.9\n\n\nBirth registration completeness rate\n2023\n90.0\n\n\nDeath registration completeness rate\n2019\n31.4\n\n\nDeath registration completeness rate\n2020\n29.9\n\n\nDeath registration completeness rate\n2021\n26.2\n\n\nDeath registration completeness rate\n2022\n31.1\n\n\nDeath registration completeness rate\n2023\n41.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, we need to check that the variables are in the correct format.\n\nglimpse(tidy_data)\n\nRows: 10\nColumns: 3\n$ Event &lt;chr&gt; \"Birth registration completeness rate\", \"Birth registration comp…\n$ Year  &lt;chr&gt; \"2019\", \"2020\", \"2021\", \"2022\", \"2023\", \"2019\", \"2020\", \"2021\", …\n$ Value &lt;dbl&gt; 87.00, 85.80, 84.20, 92.90, 90.04, 31.40, 29.90, 26.20, 31.10, 4…\n\n\nWe can see that the ‘Year’ variable has been stored as a character rather than as a numeric variable. This will cause us problems when we map this variable to the chart’s x-axis. To rectify this we can use the mutate() function to convert ‘Year’ to an integer.\n\ntidy_data &lt;- tidy_data |&gt; \n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\nLet’s check to see if that worked.\n\n\nRows: 10\nColumns: 3\n$ Event &lt;chr&gt; \"Birth registration completeness rate\", \"Birth registration comp…\n$ Year  &lt;int&gt; 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023\n$ Value &lt;dbl&gt; 87.00, 85.80, 84.20, 92.90, 90.04, 31.40, 29.90, 26.20, 31.10, 4…\n\n\nWhile we are formatting the data we might also abbreviate the values contained in the ‘Event’ variable from ‘Birth registration completeness rate’ to simply ‘Births’. We can do this using mutate() and the str_detect() function from the stringr package which detects the presence of a pattern in a string. Here we overwrite the value in the ‘Event’ column with ‘Births’ if we str_detect() the pattern ‘Birth’ and with ‘Deaths’ if we don’t.\n\ntidy_data &lt;- tidy_data |&gt; \n  mutate(Event = ifelse(str_detect(Event, \"Birth\"), \"Births\", \"Deaths\"))\n\nLet’s look again at the data.\n\n\n\n\nTable 7.3: Abbreviated ‘Event’ values\n\nEvent\nYear\nValue\n\n\n\nBirths\n2019\n87.0\n\n\nBirths\n2020\n85.8\n\n\nBirths\n2021\n84.2\n\n\nBirths\n2022\n92.9\n\n\nBirths\n2023\n90.0\n\n\nDeaths\n2019\n31.4\n\n\nDeaths\n2020\n29.9\n\n\nDeaths\n2021\n26.2\n\n\nDeaths\n2022\n31.1\n\n\nDeaths\n2023\n41.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are now ready to visualise the data in a line chart."

    "section": "\n7.4 Creating a plot",
    "text": "7.4 Creating a plot\nLoad the data and map variables\nFirst we pass the data to a ggplot() object and map the ‘Year’ variable to the x-axis, ‘Value’ to the y-axis, and ‘Event’ to colour. Each argument is within the aes() function because the variables are mapped to the aesthetics or visual properties of the line chart. We can see that the values have been mapped to the axes because they have been scaled but there are no lines …\n\n\n\nggplot(tidy_data, aes(x = Year, y = Value, colour = Event))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd lines\nTo add lines we need to specify a geom. In this case we simply add geom_line().\n\n\n\nggplot(tidy_data, aes(x = Year, y = Value, colour = Event)) +\n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe are using + rather than the conventional |&gt; because ggplot2 predates the pipe operator.\n\n\nChange the line width\nOne of the arguments of geom_line() is linewidth which we can adjust to suit.\n\n\n\nggplot(tidy_data, aes(x = Year, y = Value, colour = Event)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the line colours\nWe can specify which colours to map to the values of the ‘Event’ variable using the scale_colour_manual() function. You could also choose a ColorBrewer palette or even colours from a Wes Anderson film. The Okabe-Ito palette is particularly recommended because they are colour-blind friendly.\n\n\n\nggplot(tidy_data, aes(x = Year, y = Value, colour = Event)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = c(\"Births\" = \"#fc6721\", \"Deaths\" = \"#E7B800\")) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormat the scale\nWe can modify the y-axis with arguments from the scale_y_continuous() function. First we need to format the y-axis labels as percentages. There is a handy function from the scales package called label_percent() which we can use. Since the values of the ‘Value’ variable are already percentages we need to add the argument scale = 1 to prevent the function from multiplying by 100.\nWe can also set the limits of the y-axis to begin at zero and end at 100.\n\n\n\nggplot(tidy_data, aes(x = Year, y = Value, colour = Event)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = c(\"Births\" = \"#fc6721\", \"Deaths\" = \"#E7B800\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,100), labels = scales::label_percent(scale = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe :: syntax is a neat way of using a function from another package without needing to load it beforehand with library(scales).\n\n\nAdd labels\nAdding labels is very intuitive with the labs() function. You can specify NULL if you don’t want to label a particular part of the chart. Here we have dropped the axis and legend labels but specified a title, subtitle and caption.\n\n\n\nggplot(tidy_data, aes(x = Year, y = Value, colour = Event)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = c(\"Births\" = \"#fc6721\", \"Deaths\" = \"#E7B800\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,100), labels = scales::label_percent(scale = 1)) +\n  labs(x = NULL,\n       y = NULL,\n       title = \"Birth and death registration completeness rates\",\n       subtitle = \"Rwanda, 2019-2023\",\n       caption = \"Source: CRVS system\",\n       colour = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a theme\nA theme is an overall plot style. Here we use theme_minimal() which removes the grey background and axis ticks.

    "text": "8.1 Introduction\nChoropleth or thematic maps visualise the variation in the values of a variable across geographical areas by encoding them in a colour gradient. Alternative graphics such as a bar or lollipop chart could be used to show the data but they lack potentially important spatial information. A choropleth map allows you to begin to identify hotspot areas and clusters of high or low values.\nHowever, there are three key issues to consider before choosing to display your data in a choropleth map.\n1. Counts or rates\nChoropleth maps that visualise the distribution of counts are sensitive to population size. The population distribution will be mapped rather than the variable of interest. It is therefore recommended to map rates or percentages so that the population at risk is accounted for.\n2. Modifiable Areal Unit Problem\nThe Modifiable Areal Unit Problem or MAUP (Openshaw, 1984) points out that the spatial distribution of values in a choropleth map may be a function of the size and shape of geographical areas. There is not much that we can do about MAUP but we need to be aware of its potential impact.\n3. Classification schemes\nDifferent classification schemes can produce very different choropleth maps (see below). As the distibution of a histogram is sensitive to the size of its bins so the spatial distribution visualised in a choropleth map can be affected by its intervals. It is good practice to inspect the values of your variable in a histogram before deciding which classification scheme to adopt."

The data are free to use for non-commercial purposes.\n\n8.3.1 GADM\nYou can either download administrative boundary files using the geodata package or directly from the GADM website. The function gadm() has two key arguments. You need to supply the three-letter ISO code to country and choose a level of administrative subdivision. 0 is the value for country and 1 is for the next administrative level down.\nThe code below loads the states of Nigeria.\n\nlibrary(geodata)\nnigeria &lt;- gadm(country = \"NGA\",  level = 1,  path = tempdir(), version = \"latest\")\n\nIf you prefer to download the files manually from the website you need to select ‘Nigeria’ from the country dropdown and then choose a file format. GeoJSON is an open, non-proprietary format that is used across the Web. There are three administrative divisions available:\n0 National\n1 States (36 + Federal Capital Territory)\n2 Local Government Areas (774)\nWe will download ‘level 1’ in GeoJSON format by copying the URL and unzipping it. We can then use the st_read() function from the sf package to load the file into the R session. The sf package converts the GeoJSON file into a simple features object, a data frame with features stored in rows and attributes in columns. The feature geometries of the object are stored in a list-column at the end. These are the coordinates that describe the boundary of each state.\n\ndownload.file(\"https://geodata.ucdavis.edu/gadm/gadm4.1/json/gadm41_NGA_1.json.zip\",\n              \"gadm41_NGA_1.json.zip\")\nunzip(\"gadm41_NGA_1.json.zip\")\nnigeria &lt;- st_read(\"gadm41_NGA_1.json\")\n\n\n8.3.2 Natural Earth\nLevel 1 administrative boundaries are available from Natural Earth using the ne_states() function from the rnaturalearth package.\n\nlibrary(rnaturalearth)\nnigeria &lt;- ne_states(country = \"nigeria\", returnclass = \"sf\")\n\nYou can also download subnational boundaries directly from the Natural Earth website.
