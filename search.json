    "text": "5.4 Valid\nVariables should conform to data types and values should fall within expected ranges.\n\n5.4.1 Characters as dates\nDates can be inputted in a variety of formats such as “1 August 24”, Aug 1, 2024”, and “2024-08-01”. Sometimes R will not be able to parse a date and will read it as a character.\nThe variable birth1a (Date of occurrence, Event) is a character but it should be a date. We can coerce it to a date by passing it to the as.Date() function and choosing the corresponding date format. birth1a follows the ISO 8601 standard for dates or ‘YYYY-MM-DD’ so we need to format the data with “%Y-%m-%d”.\n\ndf &lt;- mutate(df, birth1a = as.Date(birth1a, format = \"%Y-%m-%d\"))\nclass(df$birth1a)\n\n[1] \"Date\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.2: Date formats in R\n\nSymbol\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n%d\nDay as a number\n01-31\n\n\n%a\nAbbreviated weekday\nWed\n\n\n%A\nUnabbreviated weekday\nWednesday\n\n\n%m\nMonth as a number\n1-12\n\n\n%b\nAbbreviated month\nFeb\n\n\n%B\nUnabbreviated month\nFebruary\n\n\n%y\n2-digit year\n24\n\n\n%Y\n4-digit year\n2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also use the ymd() function which more intuitively transforms the date into year, month, and day.\n\nmutate(df, birth1a = ymd(birth1a))\n\nWe can see that some registration dates have been entered as “1900-01-01”.\n\n5.4.2 Characters as factors\nIt is common practice to read known values of a variable as characters, hence stringsAsFactors = FALSE. However, once you have read in the data you may wish to convert a character variable into a factor. Here we are converting birth1g (Type of birth, Event) into a factor.\n\nclass(df$birth1g)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\ndf$birth1g &lt;- as_factor(df$birth1g)\nclass(df$birth1g)\n\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n\n\n5.4.3 Remove white space\nLeading and trailing white space can easily be coded in error with manual data entry. We can get rid of these blank characters with the str_squish() function from the stringr package.\n\nstr_squish(\" Federal    Capital Territory\")\n\n[1] \"Federal Capital Territory\"\n\n\n\n5.4.4 Values within expected range\nSometimes there can be rogue values in a dataset that have been entered in error. We can check for these by calculating some summary statistics. The skim() function from the skimr package prints the average, quartiles and a neat histogram.\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nskim(df, \"birth3b\")\n\n\n\n\n── Variable type: numeric ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n  skim_variable n_missing complete_rate mean   sd p0 p25 p50 p75 p100 hist \n1 birth3b              10         0.990 44.6 26.5  0  22  44  68   90 ▇▇▇▇▇\n\n\n\n5.4.5 Wrong order of levels\nSometimes the order of levels in a factor variable is not very helpful. The fct_relevel() function allows you to customise the order of levels. Here we reorder the values of birth1g (Type of birth, Event) so that “Single” comes first, then “Twin” etc.\n\ndf$birth1g |&gt; levels()\n\n[1] \"Quadruplet or higher\" \"Single\"               \"Triplet\"             \n[4] \"Twin\"                \n\ndf$birth1g |&gt; fct_relevel(\"Single\", \"Twin\", \"Triplet\", \"Quadruplet or higher\") |&gt; levels()\n\n[1] \"Single\"               \"Twin\"                 \"Triplet\"             \n[4] \"Quadruplet or higher\"\n\n\n\n5.4.6 Recode values\nOften values of a variable are coded unhelpfully. For example, in birth2a (Sex, Newborn) the sex of the newborn baby has been recorded as “M” and “F”. We can easily recode these so that they are more readable. The fct_recode() function enables you to change factor levels by hand.\n\ndf$birth2a |&gt; \n  fct_recode(Female = \"F\", Male = \"M\") |&gt; \n  levels()\n\n[1] \"Female\" \"Male\"  \n\n\nYou can also use the case_match() function within mutate().\n\ndf |&gt;\n  mutate(birth2a = case_match(birth2a, \"F\" ~ \"Female\", \"M\" ~ \"Male\"))"

The function will return any duplicate records and add a dupe_count column containing the number of duplicates. You just need to supply a unique identifier e.g. `id`` or a unique combination of columns.\n\ndf |&gt; \n  get_dupes(id)\n\n   id dupe_count    birth1a    birth1b   birth1c              birth1g birth1h\n1 944          5 2024-06-21 2024-06-29 Nassarawa Quadruplet or higher   Other\n2 944          5 2024-06-21 2024-06-29 Nassarawa Quadruplet or higher   Other\n3 944          5 2024-06-21 2024-06-29 Nassarawa Quadruplet or higher   Other\n4 944          5 2024-06-21 2024-06-29 Nassarawa Quadruplet or higher   Other\n5 944          5 2024-06-21 2024-06-29 Nassarawa Quadruplet or higher   Other\n  birth1i birth2a birth3b\n1 Unknown       F      27\n2 Unknown       F      27\n3 Unknown       F      27\n4 Unknown       F      27\n5 Unknown       F      27\n\n\n\n5.6.2 Removing duplicates\nTo drop duplicate rows whilst retaining the first row we can use the distinct() function. Remember to pass the argument .keep_all = TRUE to keep all the variables not just the unique identifier.\n\ndf |&gt;\n  distinct(id, .keep_all = TRUE)\n\n\n5.6.3 Convert values to NA\nMissing values are recorded in a variety of ways e.g. 999999, NULL, or even ” “. We can recode these missing values to a more explicit NA using the na_if() function. The variable birth1c (Place of occurrence, Event) includes a number of missing values that have been recorded as” “. We can replace these with NA using the code below.\n\ndf &lt;- mutate(df, birth1c = na_if(birth1c, \"\"))\n\nYou can also use the case_match() function as an alternative.\n\ndf &lt;- mutate(df, birth1c = case_match(birth1c, NA ~ \"\", .default = birth1c))\n\n\n5.6.4 Checking missing data\nTo identify how many missing values there are in the whole dataset we can run:\n\ndf |&gt; map_dbl(~sum(is.na(.)))\n\n     id birth1a birth1b birth1c birth1g birth1h birth1i birth2a birth3b \n      0       0       0       0       0       0       0       0      10 \n\n\nThere are 0 NA values in birth1c (Place of occurrence, Event) and 10 in birth3b (Age, Mother).\n\n5.6.5 Fill missing value with previous value\nSometimes values are not explicit in a dataset. For example, you might have some population data and only the first value explicitly records the sex.\n\nkable(pop)\n\n\n\nAge\nSex\nPopulation\n\n\n\n0-4\nMale\n9432700\n\n\n5-9\nNA\n7875387\n\n\n10-14\nNA\n7088327\n\n\n15-19\nNA\n6159773\n\n\n20-24\nNA\n5139436\n\n\n25-29\nNA\n4238963\n\n\n30-34\nNA\n3443384\n\n\n35-39\nNA\n2756472\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can solve this problem with the fill() function which takes the previous value and uses it to fill subsequent missing values.\n\npop |&gt; fill(Sex)\n\n\n\n\n\nAge\nSex\nPopulation\n\n\n\n0-4\nMale\n9432700\n\n\n5-9\nMale\n7875387\n\n\n10-14\nMale\n7088327\n\n\n15-19\nMale\n6159773\n\n\n20-24\nMale\n5139436\n\n\n25-29\nMale\n4238963\n\n\n30-34\nMale\n3443384\n\n\n35-39\nMale\n2756472\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.6.6 Imputing missing data\nIn cases where there are missing values in an integer variable we can impute them as an average. For example, there are 10 missing values in birth3b (Age, Mother). We can impute the mean age with the following code.\n\ndf &lt;- df |&gt; \n  mutate(birth3b = case_when(\n    is.na(birth3b) ~ as.integer(mean(birth3b, na.rm = TRUE)),\n    TRUE ~ birth3b)\n    )"

    "text": "7.3 Cleaning data\nRwanda’s 2023 Vital Statistics Report is accompanied by an Excel file containing data for all of the figures. Table 7.1 contains all the values encoded in Figure 7.1.\n\n\n\n\nTable 7.1: Birth and death registration completeness rates in Rwanda, 2019 to 2023\n\nEvent\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n\n\n\nBirth registration completeness rate\n87.0\n85.8\n84.2\n92.9\n90.0\n\n\nDeath registration completeness rate\n31.4\n29.9\n26.2\n31.1\n41.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we can visualise the data in a line chart we need to transform it from a table into ‘tidy’ data (Wickham 2014). To be tidy the data must satisfy three rules:\n\nEach variable must have its own column\nEach observation must have its own row\nEach value must have its own cell\n\nThe key step to make this data ‘tidy’ is to reshape it into ‘long format’ using the pivot_longer() function from the dplyr package (Wickham et al. 2023). This function converts some of the column names into values of a new variable. In this case, the year column names become the values of a new variable called ‘Year’.\n\ntidy_data &lt;- table |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(-Event, names_to = \"Year\", values_to = \"Value\")\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 7.2: Data structured in long format\n\nEvent\nYear\nValue\n\n\n\nBirth registration completeness rate\n2019\n87.0\n\n\nBirth registration completeness rate\n2020\n85.8\n\n\nBirth registration completeness rate\n2021\n84.2\n\n\nBirth registration completeness rate\n2022\n92.9\n\n\nBirth registration completeness rate\n2023\n90.0\n\n\nDeath registration completeness rate\n2019\n31.4\n\n\nDeath registration completeness rate\n2020\n29.9\n\n\nDeath registration completeness rate\n2021\n26.2\n\n\nDeath registration completeness rate\n2022\n31.1\n\n\nDeath registration completeness rate\n2023\n41.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, we need to check that the variables are in the correct format.\n\nglimpse(tidy_data)\n\nRows: 10\nColumns: 3\n$ Event &lt;chr&gt; \"Birth registration completeness rate\", \"Birth registration comp…\n$ Year  &lt;chr&gt; \"2019\", \"2020\", \"2021\", \"2022\", \"2023\", \"2019\", \"2020\", \"2021\", …\n$ Value &lt;dbl&gt; 87.00, 85.80, 84.20, 92.90, 90.04, 31.40, 29.90, 26.20, 31.10, 4…\n\n\nWe can see that the ‘Year’ variable has been stored as a character rather than as a numeric variable. This will cause us problems when we map this variable to the chart’s x-axis. To rectify this we can use the mutate() function to convert ‘Year’ to an integer.\n\ntidy_data &lt;- tidy_data |&gt; \n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\nLet’s check to see if that worked.\n\n\nRows: 10\nColumns: 3\n$ Event &lt;chr&gt; \"Birth registration completeness rate\", \"Birth registration comp…\n$ Year  &lt;int&gt; 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023\n$ Value &lt;dbl&gt; 87.00, 85.80, 84.20, 92.90, 90.04, 31.40, 29.90, 26.20, 31.10, 4…\n\n\nWhile we are formatting the data we might also abbreviate the values contained in the ‘Event’ variable from ‘Birth registration completeness rate’ to simply ‘Births’. We can do this using mutate() and the str_detect() function from the stringr package which detects the presence of a pattern in a string. Here we overwrite the value in the ‘Event’ column with ‘Births’ if we str_detect() the pattern ‘Birth’ and with ‘Deaths’ if we don’t.\n\ntidy_data &lt;- tidy_data |&gt; \n  mutate(Event = ifelse(str_detect(Event, \"Birth\"), \"Births\", \"Deaths\"))\n\nLet’s look again at the data.\n\n\n\n\nTable 7.3: Abbreviated ‘Event’ values\n\nEvent\nYear\nValue\n\n\n\nBirths\n2019\n87.0\n\n\nBirths\n2020\n85.8\n\n\nBirths\n2021\n84.2\n\n\nBirths\n2022\n92.9\n\n\nBirths\n2023\n90.0\n\n\nDeaths\n2019\n31.4\n\n\nDeaths\n2020\n29.9\n\n\nDeaths\n2021\n26.2\n\n\nDeaths\n2022\n31.1\n\n\nDeaths\n2023\n41.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are now ready to visualise the data in a line chart."

    "text": "7.4 Creating a plot\nLoad the data and map variables\nFirst we pass the data to a ggplot() object and map the ‘Year’ variable to the x-axis, ‘Value’ to the y-axis, and ‘Event’ to colour. Each argument is within the aes() function because the variables are mapped to the aesthetics or visual properties of the line chart. We can see that the values have been mapped to the axes because they have been scaled but there are no lines …\n\n\n\nggplot(tidy_data, aes(x = Year, y = Value, colour = Event))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd lines\nTo add lines we need to specify a geom. In this case we simply add geom_line().\n\n\n\nggplot(tidy_data, aes(x = Year, y = Value, colour = Event)) +\n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe are using + rather than the conventional |&gt; because ggplot2 predates the pipe operator.\n\n\nChange the line width\nOne of the arguments of geom_line() is linewidth which we can adjust to suit.\n\n\n\nggplot(tidy_data, aes(x = Year, y = Value, colour = Event)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the line colours\nWe can specify which colours to map to the values of the ‘Event’ variable using the scale_colour_manual() function. You could also choose a ColorBrewer palette or even colours from a Wes Anderson film. The Okabe-Ito palette is particularly recommended because they are colour-blind friendly.\n\n\n\nggplot(tidy_data, aes(x = Year, y = Value, colour = Event)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = c(\"Births\" = \"#fc6721\", \"Deaths\" = \"#E7B800\")) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormat the scale\nWe can modify the y-axis with arguments from the scale_y_continuous() function. First we need to format the y-axis labels as percentages. There is a handy function from the scales package called label_percent() which we can use. Since the values of the ‘Value’ variable are already percentages we need to add the argument scale = 1 to prevent the function from multiplying by 100.\nWe can also set the limits of the y-axis to begin at zero and end at 100.\n\n\n\nggplot(tidy_data, aes(x = Year, y = Value, colour = Event)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = c(\"Births\" = \"#fc6721\", \"Deaths\" = \"#E7B800\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,100), labels = scales::label_percent(scale = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe :: syntax is a neat way of using a function from another package without needing to load it beforehand with library(scales).\n\n\nAdd labels\nAdding labels is very intuitive with the labs() function. You can specify NULL if you don’t want to label a particular part of the chart. Here we have dropped the axis and legend labels but specified a title, subtitle and caption.\n\n\n\nggplot(tidy_data, aes(x = Year, y = Value, colour = Event)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = c(\"Births\" = \"#fc6721\", \"Deaths\" = \"#E7B800\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,100), labels = scales::label_percent(scale = 1)) +\n  labs(x = NULL,\n       y = NULL,\n       title = \"Birth and death registration completeness rates\",\n       subtitle = \"Rwanda, 2019-2023\",\n       caption = \"Source: CRVS system\",\n       colour = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a theme\nA theme is an overall plot style. Here we use theme_minimal() which removes the grey background and axis ticks. The base_size argument allows us to resize the overall font size of the labels.\n\n\n\nggplot(tidy_data, aes(x = Year, y = Value, colour = Event)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = c(\"Births\" = \"#fc6721\", \"Deaths\" = \"#E7B800\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,100), labels = scales::label_percent(scale = 1)) +\n  labs(x = NULL,\n       y = NULL,\n       title = \"Birth and death registration completeness rates\",\n       subtitle = \"Rwanda, 2019-2023\",\n       caption = \"Source: CRVS system\",\n       colour = NULL) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal tweaks\nNext we’ll remove unnecessary grid lines and move the legend to the bottom of the plot. There are several other options available using the theme() function.\nWe can also move the y-axis labels to the right side so that the latest values are easier to read. This is achieved by adding the argument position = \"right\" in the scale_y_continuous() function.\n\n\n\nggplot(tidy_data, aes(x = Year, y = Value, colour = Event)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = c(\"Births\" = \"#fc6721\", \"Deaths\" = \"#E7B800\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,100), labels = scales::label_percent(scale = 1), position = \"right\") +\n  labs(x = NULL,\n       y = NULL,\n       title = \"Birth and death registration completeness rates\",\n       subtitle = \"Rwanda, 2019-2023\",\n       caption = \"Source: CRVS system\",\n       colour = NULL) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can add expand = expansion() in scale_y_continuous to reduce the gap between the x-axis labels and the axis line.\n\n\nSave the plot\nLastly we can export the plot as a PNG and set the resolution to 300 dpi which is perfect for printing.\n\nggsave(\"plot.png\", scale = 1, dpi = 300)"

    "section": "\n8.1 Introduction",
    "text": "8.1 Introduction\nChoropleth or thematic maps visualise the variation in the values of a variable across geographical areas by encoding them in a colour gradient. Alternative graphics such as a bar or lollipop chart could be used to show the data but they lack potentially important spatial information. A choropleth map allows you to begin to identify hotspot areas and clusters of high or low values.\nHowever, there are three key issues to consider before choosing to display your data in a choropleth map.\n1. Counts or rates\nChoropleth maps that visualise the distribution of counts are sensitive to population size. The population distribution will be mapped rather than the variable of interest. It is therefore recommended to map rates or percentages so that the population at risk is accounted for.\n2. Modifiable Areal Unit Problem\nThe Modifiable Areal Unit Problem or MAUP (Openshaw, 1984) points out that the spatial distribution of values in a choropleth map may be a function of the size and shape of geographical areas. There is not much that we can do about MAUP but we need to be aware of its potential impact.\n3. Classification schemes\nDifferent classification schemes can produce very different choropleth maps (see below). As the distibution of a histogram is sensitive to the size of its bins so the spatial distribution visualised in a choropleth map can be affected by its intervals. It is good practice to inspect the values of your variable in a histogram before deciding which classification scheme to adopt."

The data are free to use for non-commercial purposes.\n\n8.3.1 GADM\nYou can either download administrative boundary files using the geodata package or directly from the GADM website. The function gadm() has two key arguments. You need to supply the three-letter ISO code to country and choose a level of administrative subdivision. 0 is the value for country and 1 is for the next administrative level down.\nThe code below loads the states of Nigeria.\n\nlibrary(geodata)\nnigeria &lt;- gadm(country = \"NGA\",  level = 1,  path = tempdir(), version = \"latest\")\n\nIf you prefer to download the files manually from the website you need to select ‘Nigeria’ from the country dropdown and then choose a file format.

There are three administrative divisions available:\n0 National\n1 States (36 + Federal Capital Territory)\n2 Local Government Areas (774)\nWe will download ‘level 1’ in GeoJSON format by copying the URL and unzipping it. We can then use the st_read() function from the sf package to load the file into the R session.

The feature geometries of the object are stored in a list-column at the end.

Uses a statistical procedure which seeks to reduce the variance within classes and maximises the variance between classes.\n+ identifies areas with similar values- the classes are unique to each variable so cannot be reused with other variables\n\ntm_shape(sf) + \n  tm_borders(col = \"#FFFFFF\", lwd = 0.5) +\n  tm_text(\"state\", size = 0.8, col = \"black\", auto.placement = TRUE) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"percent\",\n          style = \"jenks\",\n          n = 4,\n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          title = \"% registered\")\n\n\n\n\n\n8.9.4 Custom breaks\nCustom map classifications can be created by supplying breaks and labels to the tm_fill() function.\n\ntm_shape(sf) + \n  tm_borders(col = \"#FFFFFF\", lwd = 0.5) +\n  tm_text(\"state\", size = 0.8, col = \"black\", auto.placement = TRUE) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"percent\",\n          breaks = c(0,40,58,76,Inf),\n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          labels = c(\" &lt; 40%\", \" 40 - 58%\", \" 58 - 76%\", \" &gt; 76%\"),\n          title = \"Total registered\")"
