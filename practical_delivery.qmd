# Practical Delivery of CRVS table Generation

Throughout the summer of 2024, a team of UNECA delivered a one-week package in a variety of countries 
to implement R based systems to obtain civil registration vital statistics (CRVS) tables.
These sessions targeted both National Statistics Offices (NSOs) and National Registration Offices (NROs).
The ultimate goal was to set a delivery path to achieve a CRVS report.

This chapter provides some guidance for future delivery sessions that have a similar goal.
At the same time, it also provides some of the lessons learnt, so you don't have to make the same mistakes we did.
